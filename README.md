# DOM-Practice-Questions
In this repository, you will find some based to intermediate-level DOM practice questions.

## Exercise#1 DOM.
> I've provided you with some simple markup in index.html. Your task is to use querySelector and querySelectorAll to select some of those elements. Select all elements that have the class of "done" and save them in a variable called doneTodos.
Select the one checkbox and save it in a variable called checkbox. Be careful, there is more than one input element on the page! You'll need to select using the type attribute.(If you can't remember the css attribute selector...google it! That's what I would do !)

## Exercise#2 DOM.
> I've provided you with some basic markup in an index.html Please use JavaScript to select the <span> element that currently reads "Delicious" Change its text to read "Disgusting" USING JAVASCRIPT. Even if you are a weirdo who likes pickles, please change the text to "Disgusting". Yes, you could cheat and just update the html file directly, but I hope you don't!  The goal here is to practice using JavaScript to manipulate HTML.

## Exercise#3 DOM.
> Manipulating Attributes Practice Let's get some practice working with DOM element attributes. I've provided you with some very basic markup.  Please select the image element and: change its source to this URL: https://devsprouthosting.com/images/chicken.jpg Change its alt text to be "chicken".

## Exercise#4 DOM.
> I've provided you with some basic markup in index.html.  Please do not change any of the markup directly.  Instead, use JavaScript to make the following changes: Select the div with the id of the container.  Using JavaScript, set its text alignment to 'center'; Select the image and use JavaScript to give it a width of 150px and a border radius of 50%.
