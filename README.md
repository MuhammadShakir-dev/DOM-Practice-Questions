# DOM-Practice-Questions
In this repository, you will find some based to intermediate-level DOM practice questions.

## Exercise#1 DOM.
> I've provided you with some simple markup in index.html. Your task is to use querySelector and querySelectorAll to select some of those elements. Select all elements that have the class of "done" and save them in a variable called doneTodos.
Select the one checkbox and save it in a variable called checkbox. Be careful, there is more than one input element on the page! You'll need to select using the type attribute.(If you can't remember the css attribute selector...google it! That's what I would do !)

## Exercise#2 DOM.
> I've provided you with some basic markup in an index.html Please use JavaScript to select the <span> element that currently reads "Delicious" Change its text to read "Disgusting" USING JAVASCRIPT. Even if you are a weirdo who likes pickles, please change the text to "Disgusting". Yes, you could cheat and just update the html file directly, but I hope you don't!  The goal here is to practice using JavaScript to manipulate HTML.

## Exercise#4 DOM.
> I've provided you with some basic markup in index.html.  Please do not change any of the markup directly.  Instead, use JavaScript to make the following changes: Select the div with the id of the container.  Using JavaScript, set its text alignment to 'center'; Select the image and use JavaScript to give it a width of 150px and a border radius of 50%.

## Exercise#5 DOM.
> I've provided you with an h1 element which contains 7 individual spans (each holding a single letter). Please write some JavaScript to make them rainbow-colored! In app.js you'll find an array of color names called colors.  It looks like: ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue', 'indigo', 'violet']. Your task is to select all spans, iterate over them, and assign each one of the colors from the colors array.  The first span should be red, the second should be orange, etc.   Your result should look like this;

## Exercise#6 DOM.
> In index.html, you'll find 6 <li> elements, two of which have the 'highlight' class applied to them. Please use JavaScript and the classList property to invert which elements have the highlight class. Basically iterate over all the <li> elements and toggle the class of 'highlight' on each one.   Your end result should look like this:

## Exercise#7 DOM.
> Without touching index.html, please use JavaScript to create exactly 100 new button elements! Add each new button inside the container element provided in index.html.  Unfortunately, Udemy's exercise tool does not support to the append method, so you will need to use appendChild.  Here are the steps: Create exactly 100 new button elements Each button must have some text inside of it (it doesn't matter what) Each button must be appended inside the container div.
